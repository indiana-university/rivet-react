HeaderNavigationSecondary adds a second level of navigation links beneath the header. This option is useful for section-specific navigation or subsites within a larger website.

To see an example site that uses secondary navigation, visit the [COVID-19 subsite](https://www.iu.edu/covid/index.html) on iu.edu.

See the [Header](#/Navigation?id=header) component for usage examples.
