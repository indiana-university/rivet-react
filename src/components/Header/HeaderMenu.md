Header.Menu can be paired with [Header.Navigation](#/Navigation?id=headernavigation) or [Header.NavigationSecondary](#/Navigation?id=headernavigationsecondary) to group similar application navigation items. In the desktop view these will be rendered as dropdown elements, and in mobile view these will be rendered as a collapse.

See the [Header](#/Navigation?id=header) component for usage examples.
