HeaderMenu can be paired with [HeaderNavigation](#/Navigation?id=headernavigation) to group similar application navigation items. In the desktop view these will be rendered as dropdown elements, and in mobile view these will be rendered as a collapse.

See the [Header](#/Navigation?id=header) component for usage examples.
