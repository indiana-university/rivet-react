A header is a section at the top of each page that contains the title of your website or application and the IU trident logo. Headers can also contain navigation links and a search button.

Branding guidelines require each site to have an IU-branded header. For more information on web branding guidelines, visit [brand.iu.edu](brand.iu.edu).

View the [Rivet documentation for Header](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/header/).

```jsx
<Header title="Application Title" />
```

An optional subtitle can also be provided.

```jsx
<Header title="Application Title" subtitle="Optional subtitle" />
```

The width prop can be used to constrain the width of the header.

```jsx
<Header title="Application Title" width="md" />
```
